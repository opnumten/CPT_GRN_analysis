# CPT_GRN_analysis

The scripts includes the following steps:
1 genes that can be binarized are filtered.
2 RNA velocity analysis with Dynamo: RNA velocity and transition graph
3 simulate trajectory on the transition graph
4 calcualtion of reaction coordinates(RCs)
5 Gene regulation network (GRN) inference with partial least square reguration and local false discover rate. 
Then the frustration score along the RCs
6 GRN analysis:community detection
